# Consortium: The NGI Boardgame
Welcome to the repository for all files concerning the NGI boardgame Consortium, the boardgame about the future of the internet we developed. Here you can find two main things: A folder with the files necessary to play Consortium, namely the cards and the board, as well as the rules.

If you have landed here from somewhere else and want to know what all of this is about, please see my [blogpost on the game's development](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/rethinking-internet-playing-boardgame/) and some of our thinking behind it.

# How to play the game
To play the game, download the files in the first folder and print them, ideally on card. The board should be printed on A3, but two A4 sheets will do. The 5 value trackers should ideally be stuck onto a thick coin or other object to make them easier to move. 
You will also need: 2 small items for each player as voting tokens (we used coloured wooden game pieces, but the colour is not super important) and a bunch of different small objects like coins, paperclips or any other tokens as currency (“Influence”).
To set up the game, shuffle the decision cards into one pile and give every player three of them. Every player also gets the three objective cards of their faction, of which they keep two and discard the other one. The gameplay is explained in the instructions.
Please not that Consortium remains quite experimental. We tested it with many people, so it should work reasonably well. If you have any suggestions, it would be great to hear them!

# How to use these resources to change the game or make your own.
For make Consortium we used open source software [HCCD](https://github.com/vaemendis/hccd). This little app takes a list of cards and their properties from a CSV file, adds images from the same folder and creates an HTML file, which can then be opened in the browers for printing or saved as a PDF. It also needs a CSS and another HTML file to define how the cards should look. You can download HCCD, which comes with instructions and an example deck to play around with. 

In this case the card icons are taken from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).
